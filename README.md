- Correlation Analysis: 
Our analysis extends beyond traditional statistical methods, incorporating advanced techniques rooted in Social Network Analysis (SNA). We construct correlation matrices, unveiling the intricate relationships between companies within sectors. The application of community detection algorithms reveals clusters of tightly interconnected companies,
providing insights into sectoral dynamics. Centrality measures, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, play a pivotal role in understanding network structures. These measures identify the importance of specific companies within sectors, uncovering key players that significantly influence the broader network.

- Comparative Analysis and Trend Identification: 
To capture the dynamic nature of the stock market, our methodology integrates a comparative analysis across consecutive years. Changes in community structures, alterations in centrality measures, and shifts in correlation patterns enable the identification of evolving sectoral trends.

- Statistical Measures and Network Metrics: Quantitative measures, such as mean correlation and maximum eigenvalues, offer a numerical foundation for our analysis. Mean correlation provides an overall indication of interconnectedness within sectors, while maximum eigenvalues signify the stability of sector-specific networks.

- Analytical Techniques
  
1 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): 
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis was applied to identify the most critical connections within the stock market network. By emphasizing the essential relationships between companies, the MST technique helps unveil key interdependencies and structural aspects of the market.

2 Community Detection: 
Community detection was employed to identify cohesive groups within the stock market. The code implements an algorithm that detects communities or clusters of companies that share similar characteristics. This allows for a nuanced understanding of how companies interact within their respective sectors.

3 Centrality Measures: 
Centrality measures were utilized to assess the importance of individual companies within their sectors. This involved the calculation of metrics such as degree centrality, providing insights into the influence and prominence of specific companies within the stock market network.

4 Time-Series Analysis: 
Time-series analysis was conducted to discern temporal patterns in stock market dynamics. This included evaluating mean correlation and maximum eigenvalue for different sectors across the years 2019-2022. Trends and variations in these metrics provide valuable information on how the market evolved over time.

5 Predictive Modeling: 
The study incorporated predictive modeling techniques to anticipate future market trends.
This involved leveraging historical data to train models, enabling the projection of potential stock market changes. The choice of modeling techniques was driven by their suitability for time-series forecasting and predictive analytics.
